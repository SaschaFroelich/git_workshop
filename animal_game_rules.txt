Preparation
1) Create a new branch that bears your name, that branches off of the master branch.
2) Create a txt-file in the working directory of your new branch. Name it all_animals.txt.
3) Add all_animals.txt to the staging area and commit with the following commit message: “Start game”. Do not push.

Your Task
- At the end of the game, the file all_animals.txt must contain all the animals created by the others (Including Sascha’s animals from Nov 6th) in the branch that bears your name (the one you created at step 1). 
- The game is finished for you once your new branch contains the file all_animals.txt containing all animals created by the others, and you have committed the file with the commit message “FINISH”.

Important!
- Between the commits with message “Start game” and “FINISH”, there must not be any other commits once you’re done. You may create commits that you later remove, if you wish, but you don’t have to.
- You must not create any temporary files.
- You may only transport information from the individual animal files to all_animals.txt by using CTRL+C and CTRL+V, without storing anything in intermediate files.
